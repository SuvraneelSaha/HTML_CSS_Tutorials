console.log(window);
console.log(window.docuement);
console.log(docuement);
console.dir(docuement);
all different js codes for accesing the window and the document 

window --> document -- > html --> head  and body are the child elements of the document --> head has meta tags --> body has elements which is shown actually in the browser 

1.
document.getElementById('firstHeading')
this will return the selected id which is in this case is firstHeading 

2. 
document.getElementById('firstHeading').innerHTML="<h1>Chai Aur Code</h1>"
this will change the code ,meaning 
the selected ID which is firstHeading will get changed due to the function 
.innerHTML with the value of Chai Aur Code 

this is how we can manipulate the page or the document 

we can do many things using js only using document object modelling
